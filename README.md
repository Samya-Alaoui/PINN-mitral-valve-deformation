Mitral Valve Deformation Measurement using PINNs

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on accurately measuring mitral valve deformations using Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs leverage deep learning techniques while incorporating physical principles, enabling precise modeling of complex valve deformation phenomena. The project aims to provide surgeons with valuable pre-surgical insights by transforming biomechanical understanding into actionable data.

The PINN approach seeks to combine the accuracy of finite element analysis and the speed of the mass-spring system, enabling real-time applications too assist surgeons during cardiac operations.

Key Features:
*Implementation of PINNs for mitral valve deformation measurement
*Integration of deep learning and biomechanical principles, with a focus on minimizing the Lagrangian due to blood pressure forces and tendon pressure
